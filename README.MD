#Sweer
**S**imple Slo**w** Larg**e** Numb**er**s

##What is Sweer?

Sweer aims to be a simple largenum library to be partnered with PoSRIC, and as
the name suggests it is simple, slow, and handles large numbers.

The current version isn't really functional as a largenum library, as there is
absolutely no documentation, the functions are confusing, and it's in-general
not usable.

##What's with this?

Currently I'm only using Sweer to display timestamps in PoSRIC, and as such
I haven't taken any steps to make this a usable library. This will hopefully
change in the near future.
